# To-Do List Application

This project is a collaborative **To-Do List manager** built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a Python back end API**. 
The Group members are: Mercy Yankey, Saidamir Osimov, Osen Mac-Iriase and Aayush Rajak
The goal is to create a task management system that can be accessed from the web UI and extended to work with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** so it can be used by LLMs like Claude.
